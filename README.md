# Product_Sales_and_Orders
📊 SQL analytics project using the ClassicModels database — uncover insights on sales, products, customers, and revenue with advanced queries.

## 📌 About the Project

This project showcases SQL data analytics using the ClassicModels sample database.
It includes business-focused queries for sales, products, customers, employees, and offices.
It is designed as a hands-on SQL analytics project to practice querying, joining tables, and uncovering insights from real-world style business data.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Explore the data – Understand the structure of the ClassicModels database and get familiar with how customers, orders, products, and employees are connected.
- Practice SQL skills – Use joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions to answer real-world style business questions.
- Generate insights – Analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to uncover useful insights from the data.
- Apply to real scenarios – Treat the ClassicModels database like a real business case and show how SQL can support decision-making.

## 🗄️Database Info

The ClassicModels database is a sample dataset often used for practice.
It has everything you’d expect in a small business system:
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customers → details of all customers

📦 Orders & OrderDetails → sales transactions

💰 Payments → payment records

🏢 Offices → locations of offices

👩‍💼 Employees → sales reps & managers

🛒 Products → the product catalog

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- MySQL – Database system for storing and querying data
- MySQL Workbench – SQL editor and visualization tool for writing and testing queries
- Git & GitHub – Version control and project hosting
- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) – For understanding relationships between tables


## 🗂️ Database Schema

* The following ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) shows the structure of the ClassicModels database and how its tables are related:
